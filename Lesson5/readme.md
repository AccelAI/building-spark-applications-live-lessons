# Lesson 4

> In this lesson, you learn how to leverage Spark's machine learning libraries to build a powerful model to predict customer propensity to buy.

We start by using Spark to prepare our data for input into a model.From there, you build a complex model for classification using MLlib and spark.ml.

But building a model isn't the whole story when it comes to machine learning. Often the most important step of a machine learning pipeline is the evaluation step.

Once you build a model, you then will evaluate and tune its performance. And finally you finish by seeing how to serialize your model to deploy it to make predictions.

## Objectives

* Understand the differences between Spark's two machine learning libraries: MLlib and spark.ml
* Learn how to effective process your data for input into Spark's machine learning libraries
* Use MLlib to perform supervised learning on large datasets
* Understand the basics of how to evaluate machine learning models with cross validation
* Evaluate machine learning models trained with Spark locally using scikit-learn
* Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline with spark.ml and perform model selection and hyperparameter optimization with grid search.
* See how to properly serialize and deploy a machine learning model trained with Spark
